Welcome To The Bluesky Project Tutorial
=======================================

This is a live session from which you can run example notebooks showing how to use the libraries in the Bluesky Project---including bluesky, ophyd, and databroker---and how to use them with popular scientific Python libraries such as scipy, pandas, and dask to solve problems in data acquisition and analysis.

To get started, double click on a notebook on the left, like `Hello Bluesky.ipynb`, and start running through the Jupyter notebook cells.

If you are not very familiar with Python or Jupyter, start with `Hello Python and Jupyter.ipynb`, a very brief tour of the Python language, IPython, and Jupyter.
